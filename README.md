Project 2: The JS project from my web development course @ IT School

## Demo

The project is deployed here:

- Used [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) API to display current weather info.
- Used [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) API to display 5 day weather forecast, every 3 hours.
- Added possibility to change current city.
- Added scroll to top button with smooth feeling :D.
